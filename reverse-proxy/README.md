Reverse Proxy for the frontend and backend to start on the same url
-This was a futile attempt to host the client code and webRTC server on the same url , using reverse-proxy, I got the client working, but not the
webRTC Server.
-I decided to do this because railway.app provided a non-secure url , and I wanted to use a secure url for the webRTC server.
-I ended up deploying it on render.com, and using the url provided by them for the webRTC server.
